# Quantum
    
See how you can simulate circuits in java [here](https://github.com/arpanojha/Quantum/tree/main/c290/java_sim) or follow the steps below:
  
# Henceforth holds the automatic code to download,set environment variables and test stange and strange fx.     
The libraries are provided by Johan Vos and are available at [strange](https://github.com/redfx-quantum/strange)  and [strangefx](https://github.com/redfx-quantum/strangefx)  
Their uses are detailed in the code provided at [quantum java](https://github.com/johanvos/quantumjava)      
  
   
### Follow the steps below to enjoy quantum simulation with Java:     
1) Choose your favourite spot in commandline    
2) git clone https://github.com/arpanojha/c290_java.git    
3) cd c290_java   
4) source .quantum_set   
5) chmod 755 c290.sh   
6) ./c290.sh   
7) echo "Et voila!"   
  
     
You are now all set to enjoy simulating quantum circuits in Java
